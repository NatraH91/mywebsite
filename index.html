<div><h1>About Me</h1></div>
<div>
    <p>  My name is Natra Hussein. I started studying a 3 weeks level 2 coding course with Code Nation on 21 July 2020. I have enjoyed studying this course immensely and I have at times found it challenging. I feel that this course has awakened a passion for Tech within me and I now know that I want to pursue a career in Tech, specifically coding and Web Development. I have learnt so much in this short period of time such as  writing code in Python,  using Visual Studio Code to bring my code to life, Using Trello and Kanban to organize my to do, doing and done lists for planning when building a game or website. I had a great experience working as part of a team to build a text based game and by doing that I also perfected the skills I would need to work on and successfully complete digital projects alone.
