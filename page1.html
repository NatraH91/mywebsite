<div><h2>1.1 - What is the importance of IT in modern buisness?</h2></div>
<br>
<p>
    The purpose of IT in modern business is anything from communication with customers to research and advertising capacity for the business. Technology affects a business’s ability to communicate with customers. Businesses use IT to communicate with customers quickly and clearly.  Businesses rely on their websites to advertise to existing customers and to draw in new customers there by increasing their profits. As customers rely more and more on business’s own social media accounts to communicate with them, the business benefits further as the communications would  help to create a stronger public image. IT is also used for communication amongst the employees of  the businesses and that would make the business more efficient and better able to provide its service.

<h2>1.2 Describe the methods, skills and resources needed to complete digital projects successfully</h2>
<br>
<P>   To complete any digital project successfully, you would need a computer or a laptop to work on. You would need to plan and prepare before starting the digital project. Software such as Trello is ideal to use for the planning, and preparation. Depending on what the digital project is you may need to use python language and use Code-pen or visual studio code to run your code. If for example your project is developing a website, you would use HTML to code the contents of the web page and CSS to define the visual representation of the content.

<h3>1.3 Plan and carry out tasks using I.T</h3>
<br>
<p>When creating my website prjoect, I used Trello to organise the structure of how to create my web page. Using the Kan-Ban method; meaning (To do, Doing and Done), I found this method to be extremely helpful when organising what I need to do, what I'm currently in the process of doing at given time and lastly, what I have completed. I will repeat this process up until everything on my 'To Do' list, passed through the 'Doing' list and is eventually fully executed in the 'Done' list.
    <br>

<h4>1.4	Describe the risks that might impact digital projects to fail. What causes digital projects to fail and why?</h4>
<br>
<p>Digital projects can fail for various reasons such as plain human error and technical reasons such as poor internet connections. The Latter issues can be avoided by saving digital projects as you go along on something like the cloud. Issue such as those caused by human error can be avoided by learning and training. Poor planning, unrealistic expectations, inconsistent communication and lack of cohesion between team members are just some of the few examples of human errors that could cause projects to fail.</p>
<br>
<br>
<h5>1.5	Describe how you would go about selecting and using I.T systems and software – How do you select the right kind of technology for the job?</h5>
<br>
<p>One of the ways you would decide on what kind of technology to use is by first deciding if you will be working from home/Office or working whilst travelling. If for example you were going be working from the office/ home you may use a desktop computer or if you are going to be mobile whilst working, you would opt to use a laptop, tablet or even a mobile phone. The kind of software you would use could also be dependent on that factor as some software would have a slightly different version for mobile phones and tablets to that of the ones that are available for Desktop computers and laptops.</p>
<br>
<br>
<h6>1.6	Describe and provide analysis on how your chosen technologies have helped you achieve your outcomes. </h6>
<br>
<p>Trello has enabled me to break down a big project into manageable smaller tasks and allowed me to organise the tasks into lists of to do, doing and done (visual kan-ban board). Organising the tasks in that way has enabled me to keep track of what I’ve done, maintain order and prioritise tasks based on their importance for this project. As I mainly worked on this project alone, I didn’t get as much use out of Trello as is possible for teams using Trello. Having used Trello, in the past, as part of a team whilst creating a text based game for this course; I know that Trello is a great visual collaboration platform which enables team members to collaborate, communicate and coordinate on projects. </p>
